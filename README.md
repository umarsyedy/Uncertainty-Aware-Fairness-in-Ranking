## Tools and Technologies  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Bayesian Ridge Regression, Monte Carlo methods  

## Approach  
1. **Fairness in Ranking**  
   - Defined fairness as equal exposure across groups.  
   - Explored methods: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing adjustments.  

2. **Uncertainty Modelling**  
   - Quantified aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.  
   - Used Bayesian regression to measure prediction confidence.  

3. **Integration**  
   - Adjusted rankings to reduce bias while accounting for uncertainty.  
   - Evaluated impact on utility (NDCG) and exposure fairness.  

## Key Outcomes  
- Achieved more balanced group exposure while maintaining ranking utility.  
- NDCG slightly improved after fairness and uncertainty adjustments.  
- Demonstrated a framework for ethical, transparent, and robust ranking systems.
